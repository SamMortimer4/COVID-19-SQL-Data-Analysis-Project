# Covid 19 SQL Data Analysis

These SQL queries analyse data from Our World In Data. They use CTEs, partitions, temporary tables and aggregate functions to provide interesting insight into the covid 19 situation across different countries. This personal project is based on the Alex The Analyst tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM). "Covid-deaths" and "covid-vaccinations" refer to a table of data spannign 2020 to 2024 sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, with "covid-deaths" excluding vaccination statistics and "covid-vaccinations" excluding infection and death statistics.
